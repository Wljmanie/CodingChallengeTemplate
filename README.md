# Coding Challenge Template

This is a template I created to safe time to solve coding challenges in web apps.

The following things needs to be done besides the content.

- [ ] Adjust the github repo link
- [ ] Fix the colorscheme in the site.css
- [ ] Change the JQuery statement in _layout.cshtml
